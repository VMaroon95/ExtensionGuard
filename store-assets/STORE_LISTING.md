## Full Description

🛡️ ExtensionGuard — Your Browser's Silent Bodyguard

Install it. Forget it. Stay protected.

287 Chrome extensions were caught spying on 37 million users. Phishing attacks use invisible Unicode tricks. AI chatbots are accidentally leaking your API keys. ExtensionGuard fights all of it — silently, locally, for free.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
